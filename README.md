# Original version of the website www.liceulteoreticaurelvlaicu.ro
# Liceul Teoretic "Aurel Vlaicu" Breaza

This was my first project, a new website for my local high-school, Liceul Teoretic "Aurel Vlaicu" Breaza.

The project was part of my Computer Science certificate in high-school, where I chose to create a brand new website for the high-school I studied at.
I was motivated to do this project because the previous website was outdated and hard to use, therefore I wanted a more organized website, with easier access to pages. 

I worked on:
  - the structure of the website
  - the design of the website
  - the interactivity of the website
  - adding all the needed information for the website such as news, documents, images and videos

Technologies used:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript
